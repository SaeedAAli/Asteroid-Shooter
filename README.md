📦 1. Create a New Unity Project

Open Unity Hub.

Click New Project.

Select the Unity version you want to use (preferably the one this project was created with).

Choose any project template (2D/etc)

Name it anything you’d like and create the project.

📁 2. Replace the Project Files

After Unity finishes creating the project, close Unity.

Go to the folder where Unity created the project on your computer.

Example paths:

Windows: C:/Users/<you>/Documents/Unity Projects/YourProjectName/

Mac: /Users/<you>/Documents/Unity Projects/YourProjectName/

Delete all files and folders INSIDE that project folder.

Copy all files and folders from this repository into that same folder.

(Make sure the Assets, ProjectSettings, and Packages folders all replace the new project’s versions.)

▶️ 3. Open the Project in Unity

Open Unity Hub again.

Click Open.

Select the folder where you pasted these files.

Unity will load the project—this may take a moment the first time.

🎮 4. Play the Game

Once the project finishes loading, open the main scene (usually found under Assets/Scenes/).

Press the Play button at the top of the Editor.

You’re all set! 🎉
